Though Logistic Regress(LR) and linear discriminant analysis(LDA) are similar there
exist some differences between the two. LR makes no assumptions on the distributions of the data
LDA assumes normally distributed variables.
LR can be unstable when the classes are well separated. less so for LDA


The differences between the results of Linear Discriminate Analysis and Logistic Regression could be caused by a number of items.
One reason could be that Logistic Regression does not do quite as well as Linear Discriminate Analysis when the sample size is small
Another reason could be that the petals of the iris are well separated and Logistic Regression is not as stable as Linear Discriminate Analysis. This could
also explain the wide range of accuracy scores we got for LR.
